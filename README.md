# qtvault
GUI for Vault on python + Qt4

NOTE: This is so far a Skeleton. To get it to work you need to:

- Setup Vault and make sure it works on the command line for you.
- Change the get_pass function to use vault instead of the current dummy pass generator

ADDITIONALLY:
- Vault does not currently support "listing" the passwords available. As soon as that works, have a look at the get_passnames function too.


Feel free to improve this.
